This repo is my working files for the Gary Simon CSS course that was released September 2022.

The directory `lesson-project-files` is a repo pulled from Gary's github. This repo is Gary's project files to complete the course.

Gary's course project files may be found here:

https://github.com/designcourse/css-course

For my repo directory, I only pushed the "Starter" directories and files because its work that I have completed; Gary's "After" directory files were ignored from my repo.
